# Flask-ClimateApp-Advanced-Data-Storage-and-Retrieval

The pupose of this project was to use both Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis, visualization, and exploration through a climate database. After plotting information related to precipitation and individual weather stations, a "climate app" would be made through Flask API. This Flask template would use its routes to return JSON dictionaries based on the queries that were developed to plot the previous graphs. 

Not fully completed. I couldn't figure out the flask routes for &lt;start> and &lt;start>/&lt;end>
